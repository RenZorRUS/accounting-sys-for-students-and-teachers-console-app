## Installation

Verify that you have the following prerequisites in place before installing the sample:

* Install Python from [https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/). You'll need Python 3.6 or later, primarily because of the use of [f-strings](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/) 
* The sample can be run on any operating system that supports Python 3.x, including recent versions of Windows, Linux, and Mac OS. 

Follow these steps to install the sample code on your computer:

1. Clone the repo with this command:
    * ```git clone https://github.com/RenZorRUS/accounting-sys-for-students-and-teachers-console-app.git```
